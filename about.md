My first programming language was `C++` when I tried to make calculator apps. In college I learned some programming languages such as `Pascal`, `C++`, `Java`, and `Python`. So far I've been learning some programming languages including `Pascal`, `C`, `C++`, `Java`, `C#`, `Python`, and `PHP`. One of my favorite languages is `C#` because its beauty and framework supporing it(`.Net`), beside it was also supported by the looks of its IDE. I created a Mini Image Processing apps using `C#` in college using `GDI+` support. In college I've learned some stuffs using certain languages like using `C#` for image processing and `Python` for Machine Learning.
