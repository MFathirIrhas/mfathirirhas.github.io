Hello! I'm Muhammad Fathir Irhas, a Software Engineer enthusiast and always learning. I'm mostly work on backend, and sometime on frontend. Although new, I have some experiences in C#, php, and some Java using spring framework. In college I did some coding with image processing and machine learning using C# and python. 

In this blog, I'll share my thoughs about anything I've read and learned. Feel free to comment and give feedbacks. Thank you.
